\begin{abstract}
El detector ATLAS, uno de los cuatro experimentos del acelerador LHC 
actualmente en construcci\'on en el CERN, tiene como prop\'osito 
principal 
el descubrimiento del bos\'on de Higgs, la part\'icula involucrada en 
el 
mecanismo de ruptura de la simetr\'ia electrod\'ebil y el origen de la 
masa, 
as\'i como la b\'usqueda de nueva f\'isica m\'as all\'a Modelo 
Est\'andar 
hasta la escala de 1 TeV. En el colisionador chocar\'an haces de 
protones 
con una energ\'ia de centro de masa de 14 TeV y una frecuencia de 
interacci\'on de $10^9$ Hz.


This thesis describes a method that allows the identification of double $B$-hadron jets
 originating from gluon-splitting. The technique exploits the kinematic
differences between the so called ``merged'' jets and single $B$-hadron jets using %track information
track-based jet shape and jet substructure variables combined in a multivariate likelihood analysis.  The ability to reject $b$-jets
from gluon splitting is important to reduce and to improve the estimation of
the $b$-tag background in Standard Model analyses and in new physics searches involving
$b$-jets in the final state. %The present algorithm, tuned in QCD Monte Carlo samples
In the simulation, the algorithm rejects 95\% (50\%) of merged $B$-hadron jets while retaining 50\% (90\%) of the tagged $b$-jets, although
the exact values depend on the jet $\pt$.
