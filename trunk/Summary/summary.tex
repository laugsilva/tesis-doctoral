\chapter{Conclusions}

A likelihood classifier has been trained to tag merged $b$-jets from gluon splitting. The method exploits the kinematic differences between merged and single $b$-tagged jets using track-based jet shape and jet substructure variables.   

This tool provides a handle to understand $b \bar{b}$ production in data and to reduce backgrounds in physics channels involving $b$-quarks in the final state.
