\section{Maximum likelihood fits}\label{sec:LLFits}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

Maximum likelihood (ML) information only parametrizes the shape of a 
distribution (i.e. one can determine fraction of signal events from 
MC fits but no number of signal events).

The extended version of the maximum likelihood approach adds an extra term
allowing the estimation of the absolute number of signal/background events.

%Adding pdfs
For N p.d.f.s, there are N-1 fraction coefficients that should sum to less 1. The remainder is by construction 1 minus the sum of all other coefficients.


Binned or unbinned MF fit. %Roofit presentation page 112

In most RooFit applications it doesn't matter. Internally binned data is represented the same way as unbinned data, a ROOT TTree with the bin coordinates.

Weights are supported in unbinned datasets. But use with care. Error analysis in ML fits to weighted unbinned data can be complicated...

\subsubsection{Unbinned fits}


\subsubsection{Fitting and likelihood minimization}

What happens when you do pdf->fitTo(*data)?

- Construct object representing -log of (extended) likelihood

- Minimize likelihood w.r.t floating parameters using {\sc MINUIT}. % [REFERENCIAS].

\section{Results}\label{sec:FitsResults}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

The likelihood template fits are performed using an unbinned maximum likelihood technique.

The likelihood Monte Carlo templates were derived from the simulated dijet sample described in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}.

Templates of likelihood were constructed for $b$, $c$, $b\bar{b}$, $c\bar{c}$ and light MV1 tagged jets separately, and these were fit to the likelihood distribution in data to obtain the fraction of single $b$, merged $b$, single $c$, merged $c$ and light jets in the data sample.  The fit is done by adjusting the relative constributions of the different templates such that the sum of them best describes the likelihood shape in data. A separate fit was performed for each $\pt$-bin.  The templates were derived from all jets passing the selection criteria defined in Section~\ref{sec:EventSelection}.


Different combinations of templates were used to fit the likelihood distribution in data. 
The sensitivity of the fit to fixing the ratio of the $c$- to $b$-flavour fractions to the value extracted from the simulation was investigated by carrying out separate fits with 5 and 3 free parameters. This was motivated by the fact that templates for single $c$- (merged $c$-)  and single $b$-jets (merged $b$-jets) look very similar leading to inestabilities in the fitted $b$- and $c$-flavour fractions.
%PARA JUSTIFICAR QUE HACEMOS LOS FITS CON 3 PARAMETROS PODEMOS MOSTRAR LOS HISTOS Y DECIR QUE LAS CORRELACIONES SON MUY GRANDES (PONER NUMEROS). EN ALGUN MOMENTO TENDRA QUE HABER UN C-TAGGER.  EN DIJET TENEMOS SINGLE-C'S, EN TTbar NO HAY C'S, SI HAY MERGED-C PERO ES ALGO QUE QUEREMOS REMOVER DE TODAS MANERAS.

\section{Systematic uncertainties}\label{sec:FractionSystematics}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------




The systematic uncertainties affecting the method are mainly those that change the shape of the likelihood tamplates used to fit the sample composition. The following contributions were evaluated:

\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.4\baselineskip}
\item
uncertainty in the track reconstruction efficiency;
\item
uncertainty in the jet transverse momentum resolution {\bf TO DO};
\item
uncertainty in the jet energy scale.
\item
heavy flavor fraction.
%the effect of jet isolation
%\item
%other $\Delta R$ cuts for B-labeling and matching
\end{itemize}


The systematic uncertainty originating from the jet energy scale is obtained by scaling the $\pt$ of each jet in the simulation up and down by one standard deviation, according to the uncertainty of the jet energy scale (see Section~\ref{sec:gbbSystematics}), and redoing the likelihood fits on data with the modified $b$, $c$, $b\bar{b}$, $c\bar{c}$ and light templates.


The systematic uncertainty originating from the jet  $\pt$ resolution is obtained by smearing the calorimeter jet $\pt$ in the simulation. The likelihood templates were rederived from this ``smeared'' sample, and the likelihood distribution in data was fit using these altered samples. The difference between the unsmeared and the smeared scenarios is taken as a systematic uncertainty. 

Changing the ratio of merged $c$ to merged $b$ fraction in 20\% only produced a marginal effect on the fit results. The total number of merged $c$ plus merged $b$ did not change showing that in reality we are measuring the fraction of merged $b+c$ together. The same result is expected if changing the single $c$/single $b$ ratio.


The systematic uncertainties are summarized in Table~\ref{tb:systematicsfits}. The largest ones arise from the jet energy scale and jet transverse momentum resolution.
